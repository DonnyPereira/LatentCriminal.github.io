Greetings, My name is Dowsen although most of my friends refer to me as "Donny". I am currently
in my 3rd year of University studying a Bachelors of Computer Science with Honours. There are a few reasons for me choosing the Studio;
* Lack of practical and theoretical subjects directly related to cybersecurity in my degree.
* I wanted to challenge myself with some hands-on technical work.
* I believe the subject is a good oppurtunity to get to meet other cybersecurity students.
* As a beginner in cybersecurity, I thought this subject would allow me to bootstrap my knowledge in cybersecurity and penetration testing.

My expections for this Studio are as such:
- To get some practical, hands-on experience with hacking, by hacking I mean using tools like Kali linux to actually break into a system.
- To introduce me to penetration testing.
- To build relationships with others who do cybersecurity at UTS.
- To learn about cybersecurity in general as well as certifications and pathways to getting a job.
