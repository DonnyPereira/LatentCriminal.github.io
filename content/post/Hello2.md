# About me
Greetings, My name is Dowsen although most of my friends refer to me as "Donny". I am currently
in my 3rd year of University studying a Bachelors of Computer Science with Honours. My career plan at this stage is to learn 
about cybersecurity in University and in my spare time work on certifications such as the CompTIA Linux+ and Security+. I believe my time at University 
combined with my pursuit of the certifications will help me obtain an internship or a job in the field of IT/cybersecurity and thus valuable experiance.
It is my hope that once I leave University, I will have a job in penetration testing. 

# My motivation
There are a few reasons for me choosing the Studio;
* Lack of practical and theoretical subjects directly related to cybersecurity in my degree.
* I wanted to challenge myself with some hands-on technical work.
* I believe the subject is a good oppurtunity to get to meet other cybersecurity students.
* As a beginner in cybersecurity, I thought this subject would allow me to bootstrap my knowledge in cybersecurity and penetration testing.

My expections for this Studio are as such:
- To get some practical, hands-on experience with hacking, by hacking I mean using tools like Kali linux to actually break into a system.
- To introduce me to penetration testing.
- To build relationships with others who do cybersecurity at UTS.
- To learn about cybersecurity in general as well as certifications and pathways to getting a job.
