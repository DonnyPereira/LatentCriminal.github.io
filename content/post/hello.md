### SLO1 — Engage with stakeholders to identify the problem

The task of the first week was to develop a static blog website using Hugo, git, and Netlify.
Unfortunately, I was unavailable on the Monday where the tutors explained the task and subsequent expectations.
Since I knew of my absence before the day, I contacted the tutors about my predicament. The tutors assured me that they would 
all necessary content would be uploaded to Microsoft teams and any clarification would be provided on the Wednesday or via email.
This was the first obstacle I faced, I had no knowledge of static sites, I had essesntially no knowledge with git, nor had I ever
used hugo or Netlify.

To combat this, I contacted 2 of my friends who were able to make it to the Monday session in advance to relay the necessary information.
On the Tuesday of the first week I started my work. I spent a frantic amount of the morning reading through all documents on Microsoft teams 
and emails. I then compiled all necessary information for the first week into a microsoft Onenote document thus helping me to find my bearings
and give me direction. After communicating with relevant stakeholders such as my peers and the tutors, I was able to mitigate my late arrival and also
successfully learn what the objective of the first sprint was. I was also able to identify the workload and expectancies of the workshop in general.


### SLO2 — Apply design and systems thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem.
After learning what the goal was, I posited ways to learn how best to go about it. The primary method was google along with youtube and stackskills.
It is here that I encountered my second obstacle. learning how to use hugo, git and Netlify to first get Hugo to generate my website and then to make it
go live. After downloading hugo, I found a website that ran me through making my first site, it took a while, but I eventually did it. I chose the "Hello-Friend"
theme because the design was simple, minimalistic, and also had a dark mode toggle which was something I really wanted out of my blog. This in essence was where I ran into my 
second problem. I was using Windows Powershell which was a pain, so I realised It would be better to use Git Bash instead thanks to Jason. But when I started my 
server, the page appeared blank. Rather than going straight to Jason I wanted to try it by myself first. I pasted the problem on google, and found many sites which reported to have the same problem.

Most of the results were stackskills, the solutions were primarily to do with the command I used to get the server up. For example using "hugo server -D" rather than "hugo server".
However after trying each and every solution,my page was still blank. At this point, I asked Jason for help. He immediatley solved it by pasting in the Hugo theme 
into the config file of the Hugo repository. The reason I didn't do this was because I did not read the whole wike guide properly. After this my webpage was up. Making 
the site live took some work and explaining from the tutors, there was also a problem with my Github. Netlify was able to look at my repositry but was not able to build my
website. Neither Jason or myself could figure out why but I felt it might be the theme. Thanks to Jasons magic touch, the website finally went live after we removed the files
from my Github and then re-added them. Another obstacle that manifested itself was my lack of knowledge of git, although it was recommended in previous semesters, whenever I tried to use
it, it would always fail. Thanks to the wiki on Microsoft teams, I had to actually learn it which again took some time. The Git site had serveral tutorials that walked through how to use it.
it wasn't long before I could create my own repositry and then update it using git thus overcoming my inability to learn git.

### SLO3 — Apply technical skills to develop, model or evaluate designs.
After my website was live I had to learn to properly change and update it. Since I had spent most of my time learning markdown and git, I was able to update the website content relatively easily with
some assistance from my peers. There were 2 obstacles that I faced when trying to update content for the blog; the first being adding hyperlinks in to other websites such as my LinkedIn, and the other 
being editing an Image on the site. The first problem I couldn't overcome because it wasn't really a problem, I simply typed in the Link wrong and thanks to the Tutor I was able to fix that quickly, although
it showcases that in the future I need to focus more on my work to avoid silly mistakes. I was able to place images anywhere on the site relatively easily, the problem however was re-sizing them. I looked all
over the internet for a solution but to no avail. Other peers tried to help me but due to the differences with the themes there was no standard way to resizing the image. I also tried to do it manually by resizing 
the image and then adding it to my local repository but that didn't work either.

I decided to leave the image and focus on the more important parts of the websites like the posts. After adding in the relevant LinkedIn and Github links at the top, I decided to model the posts. Each post would 
have a cover image abstractly representing the post as well as the date and a title. I also liked to add a little quote just for fun. Within each post, headings would be used to seperate bits of information to
make the site neat and easier to read. One of the other reasons for choosing this theme was that the font was well-suited to reading, especailly with the dark theme.


### SLO4 — collaborate and communicate

I collaborated a lot on the first day due to my absence and with the help of my peers I was able to get up to speed relatively easily. Furthermore, I helped my friend with his website when he had problems trying to get
an image for his first post. In addition, when the guest speaker came in to talk to the students about life in cybersecurity, I was able to articulate my need for advice for beginners in the cybersecurity field. I asked because 
I needed to know but also because there were other students from my course who were also beginners. I also came in to the non-mandatory Wednesday session to meet others who also needed help on their websites. After meeting these 
students, I've been able to communicate with them better and vice versa.


### SLO5 — conduct self, peer and team review

In terms of my performance, there were some areas I would like to focus on such as attention to detail and also maintaining focus as I tend to make silly mistakes. On a more positive note, I am
happy with my performance and willingness to finish this before the due date. As soon as I arrived back, I started on the website and grinded until I could not go further. With the help from the tutors
by Wednesday my site was live and by Friday my website was finished. In terms of my peers, the students have been incredably helpful and are really easy to get along with. Most of my peers, like me, strived to
finish the website as soon as possible and learn as much as they could while doing it. The tutors are also really helpful and easy to work with.
