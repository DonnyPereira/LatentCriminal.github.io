### SLO1 — Introduction 
The theme of this week is web application pen testing.

 I have also gotten a lot better at using a schedule. One thing I have found which I have included in my portfolio this week is my declaration of goals, justifications for them, and methods for achievement . By clearly defining my goals in a non-abstract concrete way, I have a target to aim at and I can clearly see if my actions are producing positive/negative results.  The methods of achievement are my way of breaking the goal down into manageable chunks and clearly defining the path I will take to achieve them. This is really important because I use this to make my schedule.



### Goals
	1) My goals for this week are to properly set up my schedule such that it accommodates for my practising of my CompTIA certifications and wargames. Furthermore, I have to do this in such a way that I can still adhere to responsibilities I already have, that being work, the deliverable, gym, and Muay Thai Kickboxing. I also have to make sure to look after my mental and physical health by making sure I give myself breaks and not burn out by grinding as well as making time for friends.
	
	2) I also wish to be much more efficient. I am aware that even with a good schedule if I don’t do things properly the schedule is pointless. I tend to procrastinate a lot mostly through YouTube and also by talking to my friend on social media.
	
	3) I would like to learn about as much of the web pen testing tools as possible, Document whatever I have done on the and upload it all on Sunday.
	
	4) I would like to start on each war game.
	
	5) If possible I would also like to start working on my Raspberry Pi.

    6) Remember things I have learnt

### How it will be achieved
	- Since I have most things already on my Google Calendar, I simply have to find out how much time per week I will allocate to studying the CompTIA certifications. I will complete this by Monday so I can schedule them in for the rest of the week.
	
	- Every day I will document how much of the day I did well and give it a score out of 100 starting from Monday. Also I will aim for accumulative improvement because it will take time for me to develop focus. So, if I only manage to hit one day with 50% accuracy, then my goal the next day is to achieve at least 51%. In other words, the goal is to finish the day better than I was at the start and over time become more efficient. 
	
	- I will aim to finish my part of the deliverable as soon as possible thus giving me more time throughout the week to study this. I will utilise the resources on the week 3 slides especially the practical ones because I learn best through labs.  
	
	- I will allocate at least 1 hour of these week to a particular war games. It isn't much but since there are so many wargames I feel this will suffice. I will also make sure to write down every step I so that I can view them at any time and see my though processes as well as learn from my mistakes. 

	- I have bootcamp workshop that gets right into starting with a raspberry Pi, I will spend at least 2 hours this week just getting into it at doing what I can in those 2 hours even though it might not be much, it's still a start.

	-I discovered this really cool app called Anki, it is a flashcard app that syncs across mobile and pc. It’s has spaced repitition, in other words if you get an answer right it won't show that card again for an extended period of time, If you get it wrong however it will show you that card again in a shorter period of time. This really helps me because I tend to forget basics after I've studied them but with this app I can resolve that.

### Monday

Started off the day with the stand-up meeting. This time talking about our strengths and weaknesses rather than our progress from the previous week. We also talked about our goals and our methods of overcoming our weaknesses. I really like how even though we all have differing levels of experience, we still share common problems. An example would be Mihailo and Anthony. I had acceptable time management to get the deliverable done just like them but all of us struggled with other things like the wargames due to procrastination and time management.

After this we discussed the deliverable for this week. The theme for this week is web application pen testing. Therefore, the deliverable was once again a group oral presentation. However, this time it was about a specific web application attack and also had to include a demonstration. Whenever the tutors are presenting, I always try to take notes on my one note so I don't forget important information and feedback. The others did this too which is why everyone remembered to introduce themselves.

After this, we all formed groups again. I like how we couldn't be in a group with the same people as last time, this way we have to work with the other members. It's good because we actually talk to the others and also because it helps with develop our ability to communicate. It took some time to form the groups and also to find a tool to use. I was with Hayden and Manish. We ended up going with SQL injection because we were all mostly familiar with it, even me because I had some mates who showed me it the previous year. Once again, like the last deliverable, we decided to use teams as the platform for communication shortly before delegating roles. Each member chose which dot points they'd do and when finished would upload their script on teams. Hayden mentioned using Canva which I had never heard of before. It was like PowerPoint except all users had access to it. It was really useful since we don’t have to spend time putting our PowerPoint together when we are all done.

We then practised the war games which was really good. We were introduced to the OWASP juice shop which was an awesome resource. It combined many wargames into a realistic experience where we had to both find the location of the flag as well as also capture it. I solved the SQL injection and due to Max's affection for me, I was chosen as tribute to demonstrate. It was a simple injection, most people only got confused when trying to figure out what to use for the admin field. They eventually realised that the same SQL logic could be used for the password and username as both needed to be true. My demonstration was a bit rocky since I typed the code wrong . Also, although I understood what I was doing, I didn't understand it enough to clearly articulate it in a manner that everyone could understand.

I also created my own instance at eatadick.herokuapp.com, Max said I had to post this URL on my sprint so here it is, #NoRegrets. It isn't the most majestic name but it is easy to remember and also details my feelings towards websites that have too many restriction on passwords.

Other than Uni today, I spent an hour or 2 on my sprint this week. I spent the rest of the night however doing the deliverable. Once again I finished my part on this day so I could spend more time on things like the wargames. After I finished, I uploaded my work on teams. The group reviewed it and we agreed that it wasn't missing anything.


### Tuesday
I didn't have time to do any work today since my family booked a diving experience for me at Sea World. I was meant to do it for my birthday but unfortunately I had Uni that day so we had to reschedule it. Luckily I had planned for this in advance which is why I had worked to finish the deliverable yesterday night. It was the shark dive wherein the Sea World staff take you into the shark tank above the 2 main tunnels. It was pretty surreal even though it’s a beginner diving experience. Nevertheless, going into the tank where these huge Grey nurse sharks were swimming was so thrilling an experience that I definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested. There was also this huge sting ray as big as a queen mattress along with many other types of fish.

{{<image src="/img/Wk3Arti2.jpg" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

The best part was that it was not contained in like a cage so the animals could literally swim right into you. My group consisted of this cool American dude from Florida who was a certified diver,  another nice couple from the US, one of which was also a certified diver, myself and a guide who was this groovy chick from Colorado also in the US. This was either a coincidence or Americans really like diving.  I had only snorkelled before but I did really well in both the training phase and the dive, so well in fact that the tour guide recommended me places in Sydney to get myself certified and made me promise to do so. 

{{<image src="/img/Wk3Arti3.jpg" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

I was so happy because I have always wanted to dive since I was 16 and I went snorkelling at the Great Barrier Reef. Often I would spend time on  Pinterest looking at people diving to old ship wrecks and there was just something about it that gripped me and filled me with interest. I was too young then and I had to wait like 2 more years and when I did finally turn 18 I was so busy with University that I forgot all about it. My parents remembered I think which is why they booked this for me and I definitely intend on getting certified. The guide told me that doing it winter was the best and that it's also cheaper then. I'll admit it took a lot of time out of my schedule especially since I had work straight after so I only had a little break in between to update my reflection for this week.

{{<image src="/img/Wk3Arti4.jpg" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

It doesn't bother me that much since I have been using a schedule for some time now. By using a schedule and setting up things in advance I don't have that do deal with the anxiety of not focusing on things like University because I know I have already allocated time for it. Although University, work and studies are important, I think it's also important to have activities like this where I pay attention to my hobbies and develop myself in other ways.


### Wednesday 
I finally went back to the gym today with my new workout, 3 weeks after being back in Australia. It felt so good to get back into it. I also have a private lesson for Muay Thai Kick-boxing on Friday that I scheduled in because I'm a bit rusty since I was away for a month and didn't practise. I also have work tonight which is good because my schedule seems to be holding up. Even with work and Muay Thai I seem to have the days mostly free this week so I can focus on University and other studies like my certifications.

I spent most of the beginning of the day Updating my portfolio for this week . The rest however I spent on hitting my goal from last week. The goal being to try different wargames as well as those from different Vendors. The first I tried was Hackspaining. I chose the SQL injection module and I did my first lab. I also made sure to document it so to include images of what I did as well as explain thought I had at the time and my overall strategy to complete the lab. In all honestly, although I completed the lab, it took me about an hour not because it was hard but because I was procrastinating quite a bit.

{{<image src="/img/Wk3Arti5.PNG" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

The next wargame I tried was Natas on overthewire. I really liked Natas because it was web ctf and moreso because it was more challenging than bandit. The hints were basically useless if you didn’t know a lot about web application which I didn't. The first 2 levels were pretty easy but level 3 was quite difficult because I didn’t know what the robots.txt file is. The harder the challenge, the better the reward in surpassing it. I didn't end up passing it because It has already been about an hour and I also wanted to try other ctfs as well.

{{<image src="/img/Wk3Arti6.PNG" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

The last wargame I tried for the night was the SQLi module on portswigger. Although I already did SQLi on other ctfs, this one on Portswigger went more in depth and showed a lot of variation of SQLi. I read through most of the notes, did the lab, passed it, and then documented it. It was really fun. Unlike when I used hack splaining, I didn't procrastinate at all  when doing Natas or portswigger. I found the reason was youtube and after closing the browser and taking off my headphones, I was pretty focused. The rest of the day I just spend updating my portfolio which takes quite some time.


### Thursday
Started the day as always with a stand up meeting. I was happy to report that I had completed a number of ctf's from different vendors. Last week one of my goals was to try the other ctf's since I hadn't managed my time well and only did a small number of bandit exercises. I am really happy with my progress for two reasons;

	-  Firstly, because my plan to overcome my time-restraints by properly building a schedule worked. Therefore I can clearly see that I have progressed further towards my goal of being more efficient.
	- Secondly, by doing the other ctf's I have also learned more in different cyber security areas. In other words, with just bandit I was able to reaffirm my knowledge of Linux. With the other sites like Natas, Portswigger and  Hacksplaining however, I was able to learn about many different things like SQl injection, Cross site scripting, basic web application function.
	
Although I wasn't able to get far, it was reassuring to me that others like Hayden also got stuck at level 3. Larry also drove home the point that our slow progress through the levels wasn't an indication of failure but rather proved that the challenges were in fact difficult. Or at least difficult enough for beginners like us. I learn a lot by practical labs which is why I really love the cyber security wargames. I learn well and I actually enjoy what I am doing so I am very motivated to do it.

The deliverable was also due today and I am proud of our work. We did get cut-off but we were basically at the end anyway. All the members of our group worked together and the result was a good presentation. I also really liked Hayden's demo which was clear and easy to understand. Manish did well too since English is not his first language, he memorised his part and although was cut off made a great effort.

Jason wasn't able to tend unfortunately but even in his absence he made a document which went through web app pen testing. I didn't get time to read it unfortunately but It is still a great resource to have. After presentations and Lunch, I worked on Natas managing to beat level 3. Larry told us that we should try to get to level 6 so that is my current aim. Furthermore, I also had both Max and Larry look at my resume. It was a great help since there was a lot of things I needed to change and also who better to ask that the person who works there.

### Friday
Woke up really excited today because it was the night of the SecTalks talk. I also bought my Pentester labs subscription and started Labbing right away. The introduction exercises were easy, the Unix ones were very similar to Bandit. Overall I really like Pen tester labs and plan to use it a lot in the future. 


Now, onto the Digital Forensics talk at PWC which is far more exciting. Not many others from the studio were there unfortunately due to the tickets selling out. I did see Larry which was pretty cool since it's always nice to see a friendly face. I did manage to meet some people even before the talk since I'm sort of extroverted. The two I first met were a guy named Ed and another named Wing which Larry was already familiar with. Unlike me, they had been to many talks and had finished their courses at UNSW. They also had jobs in the infosec industry so it was interesting talking to them. 

I was so excited. The speaker, Phill Moore was amazing, quite literally. He spoke about his experiences in digital forensics when he was a working for the NSW police force. I decided not to try an scribe everything he was saying because if I tried to write notes I wouldn't be able to focus on what he was saying. Instead I just took down one-word notes like program names or important strategies. 

The talk was so interesting to me because it was about digital forensics which is one of the avenues of cyber security I am actually really interested in. Furthermore, I also got to hear actual case files so I could see just exactly what the field is like. I also got some resources at the end to learn about digital forensics.

{{<image src="/img/Wk3Arti8.jpg" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

One thing I found interesting was just how much information was stored about the users on a windows system.  There was this one case Phil was talking about where he was trying to find some bad files on a suspects laptop where the file location was encrypted. Bad files are the name he gave to files that were the critical piece of information in an investigation that proved illegal behaviour. What was interesting was his plan of attack. Although he couldn't crack the encryption to show that the bad files were in the encrypted media,  he circumvented the obstacle by using LNK files. Instead he showed that there were indeed bad files on the laptop before they were moved. He might not have known whether the bad files were on the encrypted media, but he did show that the suspect, at one point, had access to the bad files. Instead of finding the smoking gun, he simply found the receipt for the smoking gun by going dumpster diving. 


### Saturday and Sunday
The afternoon was pretty productive since I started on my studies for my CompTIA Linux+ and my  A+. The first thing I did was get the exam topics and then make a plan including resources and methods of studying. I decided to not study for my Security+ as yet. I realised that studying for 3 certifications whilst also juggling University was too much. So, I reduced my workload until I could get a schedule where I am so efficient that I have a lot of free time or simply finish the A+ and Linux+ first. So far I have achieved goals 1, 3, and 4. Next week I will try to achieve the others.

I also got back into Kick-Boxing, it was really nice to train with the masters again. It was a great way to reduce stress from work while helping with cardio training. I had to work mostly on these 2 days so I spent the majority of my time writing up and editing my portfolio as well as fixing up my resume.

### Conclusion

This week went pretty well, even with my birthday celebrations and work I had managed to keep on top of my work. Furthermore, after my interview with the tutors, I was told that my effort so far was good and that I need to keep up the good work. I was happy to hear this and I plan to put in as much effort as I can into this studio. The people in the studio are amazing, the content we learn is great, and I will say that it is definately my favourite subject so far at UTS. Unlike the other subjects, the tutors are easier to talk to since they were recently at our stage and moreso the work is really practical which I like. My goals for next week are to keep my effort up, Schedule in the time outside of Uni to study for CompTIA exams, and to finish as many war games as I can.
