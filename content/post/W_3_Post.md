### Conclusion

This week went pretty well, even with my birthday celebrations and work I had managed to keep on top of my work. Furthermore, after my interview with the tutors, I was told that my effort so far was good and that I need to keep up the good work. I was happy to hear this and I plan to put in as much effort as I can into this studio. The people in the studio are amazing, the content we learn is great, and I will say that it is definately my favourite subject so far at UTS. Unlike the other subjects, the tutors are easier to talk to since they were recently at our stage and moreso the work is really practical which I like. My goals for next week are to keep my effort up, Schedule in the time outside of Uni to study for CompTIA exams, and to finish as many war games as I can.
