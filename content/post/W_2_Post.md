### SLO1 — Engage with stakeholders to identify the problem
Talk about the use of Linux necessity with paddy


This week I met Mark, the 3rd tutor. There were 2 guest speakers at the sprint. The first speaker: Patrick spoke about Linux for those in cybersecurity. It was interesting because he was a gamer and also mainly used linux. My reason for not moving to linux was partly lack of knowledge and also not being able to play games. He made a very good argument, he said by switching to linux to run his server and his laptop or desktop, anytime something broke, he was forced to fix it. In other words he had to learn to use linux no matter what, if his server stopped working, his wife and kids would complain, and then he would have to fix it. The same thing applied to games, if he wanted to play games, he would have to learn how to get them to run them on windows.

This really resonated with me because it made me consider using Linux the same way, If I wanted to get good at using linux, then I would have to force myself to use it. It would be troublesome at first but after making mistakes I would learn and then I would not make the same mistake again. Or, if I did make the same mistake again then I'd know how to fix it. So far I have installed Dual-booted CentOS on my Laptop, since my SSD is 1TB, I might also download "Manjaro" and eventually make that my only OS on my desktop. 

Talk about talking with the tutors for the assignment

Talk about the cybersec talk with rob mitchell



### SLO2 — Apply design and systems thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem.
Talk about dual-booting CentOS for linux plus, installing Manjora on my desktop and using Azure to spin up linux distributions

After Patrick's talk, I started googling resources for my Linux+ exam. The CompTIA's Linux+ exam unlike that of RedHat differec in that Redhat focused soley on their enterprise Linux distrinution. The CompTIA certification, although using CentOS as the example was said to be more broader and applicable to other versions of Linux. I was really inspired by Patrick  

Talk about Rob Mitchells talk, use notes when talking about this

Talk about studying for Security Plus due to Rob mitchell

### SLO3 — Apply technical skills to develop, model or evaluate designs.
Talk about doing over the wire bandit and the problems with it.

Talk about how we researched gobuster and used it.



### SLO4 — collaborate and communicate
Talk about collaborating with the team on which parts to do

Talk about Paddy's responcse

During Patricks talk, I asked him, "as a beginner", how would I become a master of linux?". He responded with; "You can't". At first, his answer surprised me but as he explained I eventually understood his point. This correlated with the idea of being pragmatic. Patrick had being using linux and UNIX since the days of its release and in his career for twenty years, THAT IS MY WHOLE LIFESPAN!!! 

Nevertheless he drove home the point that no matter how much he learned, there was so much more he could learn. He stated that the most important part of his learning was when something unexpected happened that stopped him from going about his work. No matter how much knowledge he had, he didn’t have total knowledge, only that which he learned. I realised that this was something I really needed to hear, I had a raspberry Pi 3 at home that I had never used since I thought that I had to learn to use linux first. But it came apparent to me that the best way to learn was to get stuck in and do what I could.

Furthermore he gave us some great resources like Unixporn which is a reddit where people post their linux *nix customisations. It's interesting to look at and use as a goal because it would be a good goal to be so comfortable at using Unix/linux that I can customise however I want and make it look beautiful too. It is also good because it has tutorials for each post and how they did it, so if I see a cool one, I can do it too. Without a doubt, this has motivated me want to learn linux so much and to also one day make my own distribution. He also went through using Linux. It was hard for me to fully follow through but I wrote down notes of important things he mentioned as well as other things that caught my eye. We also talked about how to play certain games in Linux. He inspired me to start using Manjora on my desktop and try to get the games on steam to work as a challenge.



### SLO5 — conduct self, peer and team review

This week was our first team project in which we had to deliver a presentation for a scanning tool called "GoBuster". At the start, not a single member of our group knew
of any scanning tools and tried looking some up on the web. Luckily for us, Max offered "GoBuster" which none of us had heard of but we decided to go with it Anyway. One of our group members was absent on the day, this was the first obstacle we faced. Furthermore, our team member was sick and thus he also missed on the great speakers 
that we had. The first thing our group did was establish communication and delegate tasks. After introducing ourselves to one another more formally, the 3 members of the group decided to use Microsoft teams as the medium for a communication since all the members had it and allowed us to both talk and share files. Then we delegated tasks, There were 4 dot points for our presentation and since we had 4 members, each of us did one.

The rest of the Tuesday was just filled with each member googling the required information for their part. We also messaged our missing group member of his work and offered any support he needed. Luckily for us, all the members of our group were diligent workers and were able to get started on their part relatively independantly. I decided to get the task out of the way as soon as possible because I knew I wouldn't be able to get anything done the next day as it was my Birthday. I stayed back for some time at Uni to get most of it done, and when I got home I decided to basically finish it off. The next day I had some spare time that allowed me to review my part and make any additional changes. The rest of the group pretty much did the same and once all of us were done, we posted our work on the teams chat. On the Thursday we were ready to present. The presentation went pretty well in my opinion, I think my voice could have been a bit louder but apart from that I think my part was pretty ok. The rest of the members did their parts well too in my opinion, philips voice was a bit low but he was sick and further away from us, we got cut off but then again that was the whole point so we all understood. It was interesting to hear that we'd have to devlop the ability to explain something complicated in a shortened time-frame and it was even better to get som experience doing it. Overall, I am satisfied with my effort as well as that of the teams and I have no outstanding problems. My goal now is to do better in my next team project.
