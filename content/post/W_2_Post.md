### SLO1 — Introduction 
This week the sprint contained 2 amazing guest speakers and a deliverable for Thursday. The first speaker was Patrick S. Kelso who worked in B1 as part if the UTS cybersecurity team. This week I met Mark, the 3rd tutor who also worked with Patrick. The deliverable was a group oral presentation wherein the group had to reasearch a scanning tool and then present it to the class. It was really interesting because each group presented on different tools, how they were used, and some even had a live demo. I found this really useful as I learnt about the tool I was assigned as well as the other tools chosen. Furhtermore, I also learnt about the pentesting methedology which was cool. On the Thursday, the groups presented, it was obvious that everyone put in a lot of effort into their work. In my opinion, I really like the harvestor group, simply because they managed to put in a live demo, even if they were cut off, the fact that they were so organised to put in a full demo was amazing. Furthermore, one of my general goals for this week was to get some experiance with the wargames like overthewire. Coincedentally, the agenda for the day was to engage in some wargames. I started on Bandit on overthewire.org and did as much as I could making sure to document things like; how I passed the level, the password I recovered, any troubles I had or things I learnt. It was a fun experiance and I can't wait to try the others. At the time of writing this post I am up to level 6, my goals for the end of next week is to get to level 20, start the NATAS game and also try out the picoctf because that look really fun. Outside of Uni, I've spent the 

### SLO1 — Engage with stakeholders to identify the problem

The first speaker: Patrick, spoke about Linux for those in cybersecurity. It was interesting because he was a gamer and also mainly used linux. My reason for not moving to linux was partly lack of knowledge and also not being able to play games. He made a very good argument, he said by switching to linux to run his server and his laptop/desktop, anytime something broke, he was forced to fix it. In other words he had to learn to use linux no matter what, if his server stopped working, his wife and kids would complain, and then he would have to fix it. The same thing applied to games, if he wanted to play games, he would have to learn how to get them to run them on inux.

This really resonated with me because it made me consider using Linux the same way, If I wanted to get good at using linux, then I would have to force myself to use it. It would be troublesome at first but after making mistakes I would learn and then I would not make the same mistake again. Or, if I did make the same mistake again then I'd know how to fix it. So far I have installed Dual-booted CentOS on my Laptop, since my SSD is 1TB, I might also download "Manjaro" and eventually make that my only OS on my desktop. 

The second speaker for the week 2 sprint was Robert Mitchell who had a rich history in the cybersecurity world. One of the things that is so mind-blowing about this summer studio is that we get to interact with real people in the cyber security industry. I've been in University for 2 years with my Major in cybersecurity and this is the first time I've talked to anyone who has actually worked in cyberseciurity other than the tutors. Back to the main point, Rob's speech was so captivating because he went throught the history of cybersecurity and how things have evolved and changed. Another interesting point was that Rob started out with a Bachelors of Arts in Analytic philosophy. And even with that, he had a rich history in cyber security, he even ran his own Security consultancy and MSS. 

For the longest time I had been bothered by the idea that I was too much of a noob in tech and IT that I was terrified of being able to break into the industry. I never knew what I wanted to do in high school for my future, the only reason I got into computer science was because I did software in in my HSC and it was fun. I only majored in Cybersecurity because the other majors didn't interest me and I always was interested in the niche area of cyber security, furhtermore Mr Robot also had made it look really cool even though I knew that Mr Robot wasn't 100% accurate. Thus, my fear of being a beginner was a large obstacle to overcome. When I heard Rob speak, just like Patrick, It motivated me and clued me in to the fact that I can actually fo well in it despite my lack on experience as long as I put in the effort. The same thing happened when I spoke to the tutors, I told them I was a total noob and they were able to reassure me because they too were beginners at some point.





### SLO2 — Apply design and systems thinking to respond to a defined or newly identified problem.
Talk about dual-booting CentOS for linux plus, installing Manjora on my desktop and using Azure to spin up linux distributions

After Patrick's talk, I started googling resources for my Linux+ exam. The CompTIA's Linux+ exam unlike that of RedHat differec in that Redhat focused soley on their enterprise Linux distrinution. The CompTIA certification, although using CentOS as the example was said to be more broader and applicable to other versions of Linux. I was really inspired by Patrick  

Talk about Rob Mitchells talk, use notes when talking about this

Talk about studying for Security Plus due to Rob mitchell

### SLO3 — Apply technical skills to develop, model or evaluate designs.
Talk about doing over the wire bandit and the problems with it.

Talk about how we researched gobuster and used it.

Talk about dowloading CentOS


### SLO4 — collaborate and communicate

The deliverable this week was the oral presentation. Funnily, at first the members in our group were complete noobs at penetration testing, the only program we had heard of was wireshark. This was a minor hurdle to overcome but a hurdle nonetheless since the whole team had to agree on a tooll yet non of us even knew any tools. Google was the answer as always, we decided to look for those already on kali linux to make things easier. The tutors assured us tha we could use wireshark if it was used offensively, but we wanted something more dedicated. Thankfully, Mark gave us a tool called GoBuster. After this the group made plans on how we would go about taclking the problem. The work was slit up between us and any communication was handled through microsoft team. By Wednesday night most of us were done, the presentations were uploaded on teams and small parts were editied for cohesion.

During Patricks talk, I asked him, "as a beginner", how would I become a master of linux?". He responded with; "You can't". At first, his answer surprised me but as he explained I eventually understood his point. This correlated with the idea of being pragmatic. Patrick had being using linux and UNIX since the days of its release and in his career for twenty years, THAT IS MY WHOLE LIFESPAN!!! 

Nevertheless he drove home the point that no matter how much he learned, there was so much more he could learn. He stated that the most important part of his learning was when something unexpected happened that stopped him from going about his work. No matter how much knowledge he had, he didn’t have total knowledge, only that which he learned. I realised that this was something I really needed to hear, I had a raspberry Pi 3 at home that I had never used since I thought that I had to learn to use linux first. But it came apparent to me that the best way to learn was to get stuck in and do what I could.

Furthermore he gave us some great resources like Unixporn which is a reddit where people post their linux *nix customisations. It's interesting to look at and use as a goal because it would be a good goal to be so comfortable at using Unix/linux that I can customise however I want and make it look beautiful too. It is also good because it has tutorials for each post and how they did it, so if I see a cool one, I can do it too. Without a doubt, this has motivated me want to learn linux so much and to also one day make my own distribution. He also went through using Linux. It was hard for me to fully follow through but I wrote down notes of important things he mentioned as well as other things that caught my eye. We also talked about how to play certain games in Linux. He inspired me to start using Manjora on my desktop and try to get the games on steam to work as a challenge.

### SLO5 — conduct self, peer and team review

This week was our first team project in which we had to deliver a presentation for a scanning tool called "GoBuster". At the start, not a single member of our group knew
of any scanning tools and tried looking some up on the web. Luckily for us, Max offered "GoBuster" which none of us had heard of but we decided to go with it Anyway. One of our group members was absent on the day, this was the first obstacle we faced. Furthermore, our team member was sick and thus he also missed on the great speakers 
that we had. The first thing our group did was establish communication and delegate tasks. After introducing ourselves to one another more formally, the 3 members of the group decided to use Microsoft teams as the medium for a communication since all the members had it and allowed us to both talk and share files. Then we delegated tasks, There were 4 dot points for our presentation and since we had 4 members, each of us did one. 

The rest of the Tuesday was just filled with each member googling the required information for their part. We also messaged our missing group member of his work and offered any support he needed. Luckily for us, all the members of our group were diligent workers and were able to get started on their part relatively independantly. I decided to get the task out of the way as soon as possible because I knew I wouldn't be able to get anything done the next day as it was my Birthday. I stayed back for some time at Uni to get most of it done, and when I got home I decided to basically finish it off. The next day I had some spare time that allowed me to review my part and make any additional changes. The rest of the group pretty much did the same and once all of us were done, we posted our work on the teams chat. On the Thursday we were ready to present. 

The presentation went pretty well in my opinion, I think my voice could have been a bit louder but apart from that I think my part was pretty ok. The rest of the members did their parts well too in my opinion, philips voice was a bit low but he was sick and further away from us, we got cut off but then again that was the whole point so we all understood. It was interesting to hear that we'd have to devlop the ability to explain something complicated in a shortened time-frame and it was even better to get som experience doing it. Overall, I am satisfied with my effort as well as that of the teams and I have no outstanding problems. My goal now is to do better in my next team project.

### SLO1 — Conclusion

This week went pretty well, even with my birthday celebrations and work I had managed.
