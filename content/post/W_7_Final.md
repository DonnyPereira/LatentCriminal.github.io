### 41152 Summer Studio 2020

### Introduction

---

I can only describe my time in this Studio as one-of-a-kind. I can say without fear of conviction that I came into the studio with very little or rather no knowledge of the subject material. I did however have a few goals at the beginning of the studio:

– Gain practical knowledge and experience with penetration testing.

– Complete a project based on penetration testing that I could put on a portfolio.

– Learn about the practice of cyber security in general.

I can say that I have achieved all of these goals and much more. Every deliverable we've had for this subject was heavily practical which I really enjoyed because I learn better through labs rather than lectures. Not only did I complete a single project based on penetration testing, but I completed multiple boot2roots and capture the flag (CTF) challenges. 

Boot2roots are challenges where an attacker is given little to no information on a target system ( usually a Web server in our case, aka a "box" ) and the goal is to achieve root access. Root access is just a term for highest administrative access. Therefore, I gained practical knowledge with penetration testing over a range of boxes, all of which I can place on my Portfolio. furthermore, due to the intense practical focus of the subject, I have gained a lot of experience and confidence in the field of cyber security. 

The remainder of this post is to demonstrate my final reflection and evidence of myself meeting the 5 subject learning outcomes (SLO's) presented within the subject outline of the studio. Before I move on, I would like to express my extreme gratitude to the tutors; Max, Larry, and Jason for their guidance and support. Because of them, I was able to take my first steps into the information security industry, and greatly develop myself. I also want to take this time to thank the other members of the studio for their help and for making the studio the great experience that it was. I am truly sad, that my time with them is over. 

# Final Reflection

## SLO 1 - Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem

Each week of the studio offered a different problem for which the students had to develop solutions for. After each week, the students would attain knowledge that would help them tackle the next problem offered by the studio.

### Week 2

Since I missed the orientation for the first week. This is the week we officially dived into the core information security material, our first steps into developing an offensive mindset. We were greeted 2 speakers, one of which - Robert Mitchell helped us understand the overall nature of cyber security. Robert Mitchell was a very interesting man, currently working at Gitlab, he had had a long career in cyber security.

Robert's talk was so beneficial as it not only went through the current nature of cyber security but built on it by going through its history, its relation to social culture, and its overall impact on the world past, present and future. He explained how hacking was, in essence, finding vulnerabilities in current systems and also the consequence of human error. Furthermore, the presentation also went through the consequences of failing to recognizing the risk of a cyber attack.

### Week 3

Every group had to find a unique web-application attack and record it. After researching, delivering with my group, and listening to the other presentations, I was able to piece together more of the problem statement for this week. 

An example of this would be the attack that my group presented - an SQL injection. An SQL injection is simply the inputting of malicious SQL code into a prompt that utilises SQL and thus giving an attacker unauthorized access to private information. Lack of knowledge would come into this and that a lot of sites that were vulnerable to this type of attack not quarantining their input and thus would not be able to defend against such an attack.

The interesting thing about these presentations, was the engagement with the tutors. The attacks that we were talking about were fairly complicated to the average person and thus so we were able to identify a secondary problem within information security. That being, the increased necessity to be able to quickly articulate to stakeholders that are not knowledgeable in the InfoSec field, critical information related to cyber security.

In addition, I also had the pleasure to meet with external stakeholders as I registered for a seminar held by the SecTalks group. The topic of the discussion was digital forensics deliver by Phil Moore who had recently worked for the police force. Here I gained more knowledge about problems in the information security industry that were not strictly related to penetration testing. 

### Weeks 4, 5 and 6

I have grouped these weeks together, as it is in these weeks that we completed different boot to roots each with their own problems. After each box completed, we were alerted to different problems with common applications. Some boxes utilised out of date plug-ins, others would not properly secure their file system, et cetera. By penetrating into these different systems, documenting the process, and outlining any mitigation strategies, I was able to abstractly identify common problems with different systems.

By the end of the studio and after identifying each micro-problem, I was able to piece together the overall problem. My final problem statement that I was able to weave together over the weeks in this studio is as such:

human error, lack of information security knowledge, utilisation of outdated systems, and poor communication skills with InfoSec professionals can negatively impact stakeholders, financially, legally and reputationally.

## SLO 2 – Apply design and systems thinking to respond to a defined or newly Identified problem

### Week 2

Above is the web application penetration testing methodology presented by the tutors. It is basically an abstracted workflow for penetration testing. It facilitated not only the process of testing the system but also making sure to properly document any necessary information. We are made to understand that each step relied on the step before it and that the reporting was critical as this is what companies and individuals would use to protect their systems. 

### Week 4

Until week 4 I'd never really utilised the web pen-testing methodology that was introduced in week 2. although I did attempt and finish the basic pen-testing 1 box in week 3, I will admit that I did it without following a proper structure and relying more on tools. However in week 4 I decided to properly implement the design and system thinking methodology to tackle the challenges of my first intermediate box – Mr robot on TryHackMe. This also helped me see how the problem statement that I had developed up until now was practically involved as I would document my methods and the mitigation strategies for the system.

### Week 5 and 6

In these weeks I heavily relied on the web pen-testing methodology as it streamlined my process of getting into the system. The boxes in these weeks were a lot harder than that of week 4 and by following such a methodology I was able to become more productive whilst at the same time truly understanding the financial, legal, and reputational consequences of insecure systems. 

The use of the web pen testing methodology was also backed up by 2 members of the Deloitte cyber security team that gave a talk on Thursday. They too stressed the vital importance of logging every tool, detail, and action. This is because in the real world, the consequences for not properly logging import information is not a bad grade. But rather being fired or even worse having customers taken advantage of by malicious attackers due to insecure systems via incomplete documentation. Another important fact about the importance of such processes and documentation, is responsibility. Penetration testers are responsible for their actions and without proper ethical methodology, they confine themselves being prosecuted.

The biggest problem I faced when trying to implement this methodology was inability to maintain it towards the end. Sometimes when completing a box like the open admin box in week 6, I would use the methodology until I reached a user. Then I would continue with testing the box and forget that I also had to complete the writer therefore costing me time later on.
