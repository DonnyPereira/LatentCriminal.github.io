### Introduction

This week - week 6, is the last week of our 6 week course. It went by so quick and if I'm being honest, I am actually very sad that it is ending. On the bright side, I have enjoyed my time in this course and I will say without a doubt, that it is the best subject I have ever taken at UTS. In terms of its content, it was absolutely phenomenal. All members within our studio, were thrown into the deep end multiple times, and each time we managed to struggle and overcome the challenges. Some charges were harder than others, and we each had our own challenges to overcome such as procrastination, poor time management, et cetera. The tutors were extremely knowledgeable, easy to talk to, and overall good mentors. Most of all, I am going to miss the other members, there are many laughs, even more jokes, and I feel that I have made some truly great friends.

### Monday

The theme for today is "size matters". So, the day started as the week normally did. We all came to class and Jason debriefed all of us on what the day and rest of the week would consist of. Some people were late so the stand up meeting was done around 11. This was officially the last week of the course sadly. For the deliverables we were told that we have to submit our week 6 reflection as well as a full write-up of our first box that we started in week 5. The write-up was restricted in that we had to make sure it was in a password protected pdf to so that no one violated the rules of HackTheBox.

Jason also gave us a particular format to follow when compiling the write-up, It was different to the way I'd normally compile my right up. It was more formal, And much more systematic. I like how we have to put it in this new format because Even after the studio ends, I plan to do many more boxes and if allowed, post write-ups on my blog. So it's a good idea to get into the habit of making a proper write-up.

{{<image src="/img/Wk6Arti1.PNG" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

We were also told of our overall submissions for this course since it ended the next Tuesday on the 3rd March. The final submission Included both reflections of week 5 and week 6 as well as the deliverables for both those weeks. Moreover, it had to include a final portfolio post which was a reflection of the whole subject. In other words we had to reflect on what was done each week until the end. It also to include a another write up of a box on had the box that we hadn't done for week 5 and 6. I could tell already that this week was gonna be pretty hectic because most of the other members had already started on their 2nd box whereas me and Phillip were still in the process of achieving root. 

{{<image src="/img/Wk6Arti2.PNG" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

We were also debriefed for the presentation on Thursday during orientation day at UTS. We were told that we did not have the monitors Like the previous year so we had to make do with our laptops. We also given the advice, to record the demo beforehand just in case anything happened with the server on the day. There would be no class on the Thursday, only preparation and delivery from 10 AM to 4 PM.

{{<image src="/img/Wk6Arti3.PNG" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

After the debriefing, Philip and myself were on the cusp of rooting the Traverxec box. We were so close yet we did not know how to do it. We'll admit, that it was definitely the most cunning route we have ever witnessed. For 4 hours, Jason, Max, and Larry were giving us the hint: "size matters". This is probably the strangest hint I have ever heard. Philip and myself actually typed this up on Google to see if we would get any results. Most people might laugh at this but, at 11 in the morning after hours of trying to solve this box, we really didn't have much to lose. In hindsight, one should not search up "size matters" on Google. We did finally root the box which was a great relief since we had to start on our other box. It was also perfect timing because lunchtime rolled around and we could have a good break. I didn't do much after I got home other than run a basic Nmap scan on the OpenAdmin box because I had other commitments.

### Tuesday

I spent this morning just making sure my write-up for the Traverxec box was done properly. last week when I was making the write up, I did it well for the first 2-3 days. However as time progressed and I hit roadblock after roadblock, my writeup for my box became ever more distorted. It went from proper explanations with snippets of my terminal window to just some out of order screenshots. I spent most of today re-organizing and putting together the write-up properly. The plan for today was to basically fix my write up. Then tomorrow I plan to make my part of the demonstration which is just getting www-data.

There are 3 people in my group for the Thursday presentation; Phillip, Matthew and myself. Matthew hasn't completed Traverxec yet, however he has no group and by Thursday he will have enough knowledge to explain whatever he has completed. I spoke with Phillip today too, neither of us have started Openadmin as we both had other commitments after University yesterday afternoon. To make things easier, I split the work with Phillip, we each make half the presentation and speak over our respective parts. I will handle presenting the initial approach to getting the semi-user: www-data, and Phillip will handle getting user shell to root. That way we do equal work and we can both focus on OpenAdmin too.

There are certainly a lot of things due as seen with the presentation on Monday. One of the advantages of using Notion once again is that I can easily arrange tasks into different Categories and rearrange them as much as I want. This gives me an easy workflow where I can visually orient myself by seeing what I have completed, what I need to do, and what I am in the process of doing.

{{<image src="/img/Wk6Arti5.PNG" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

On the Monday when Jason was explaining what we had to do for this week, it was a bit hard to fully conceptualize what we had to do. After I finally understood the requirements, I simply made a list and them transformed that list into this task board. The function of this page is quite similar to that of Trello (below) or Asana which is simply a paid version of Trello.

{{<image src="/img/Wk6Arti6.PNG" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

The most interesting part of the day was the ninja night hosted by Sectalks. It was a really fun night, it was held at Google and the catering was amazing. David, Dylan, Anthony, Matthew, Phillip, Max, Darshil and myself attended. Funnily enough, some of us were split up because of team sizes. Matthew had to go with the cyber rangers who were a group comprised mainly of people from google itself. I can only assume that that must of been a great networking opportunity. Phillip was put on a team called K15 comprised mainly of people who had graduated from UNSW. I knew some of them from the previous Sectalks event so it was great to see them again.

{{<image src="/img/Wk6Arti7.PNG" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

Overall it was a really great experience, first of all being inside the Google building, and 2nd of all actually competing in the capture the flag event. Finally enough, both Larry and Max for themselves now as beginners. This was odd considering Max was the president the UTS cybersecurity Society and Larry was the Vice-president at one point too. I realised why this was the case after the CTF was finished. Usually at the ninja nights, there is an easy CTF and a difficult CTF. This night was different in that it only had a difficult capture the flag. The reason Larry and Max put themselves down as beginners was because the difficulty of the CTF at these ninja nights were much more difficult than conventional CTF's say on bandit or TryHackMe. Unfortunately we were not able to get the flag in the time limit. The benefit however is that we learnt how do it when the winning team presented their solution. That way in the future, if we ever encounter a similar problem, we will have an edge.

### Wednesday

I chose to go to Uni today because there were some things that I needed to do and I knew I would need Jason's help for some of them. Furthermore I also needed to get my summer studio T-shirt which I could not do when I first started the course because I arrived late.

{{<image src="/img/Wk6Arti9.PNG" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

 The first thing I had to do was create my demo for the next day.  I decided to use a preinstalled software on my Kali linux called Kazam.  it was a basic software that basically captured my screen and the movements of the cursor and is output the file .

{{<image src="/img/Wk6Arti10.PNG" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

It took a while but I eventually made the demo. I had to edit it a bit because I did make a few command mistakes when I was making the demo. So, I simply remove those out when I was editing them. Once I was finished I simply exported the file and saved it on my SSD.

{{<image src="/img/Wk6Arti11.PNG" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

The demo took longer than expected however getting it done was the top priority. After I finished the demo I decided to work on my blog, mainly trying to change the URL. When I first created this blog in the first week, I had come to university late because I was overseas. Due to this I did not know that the blog was going to be something we could use in other aspects of our life. I thought it was simply the first assignment and didn't really have much meaning since the studio was about Cyber security. After had come back and had already started on the blog, I did not give it a meaningful URL, it was simply called "portfoli.me". Of course, after I came to university, the tutors explained that I could use this website as a portfolio which should be really useful and So keeping the URL as is simply wouldn't do. I could have changed it earlier but I always had a lot of work to do so I pushed back. I did have to pay for my 2nd domain name from name cheap, but it wasn't that expensive so I didn't mind.

{{<image src="/img/Wk6Arti12.PNG" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

Most of my friends refer to me as Donny, Max likes to also call me the Don so I decided to brand my portfolio as "donnythedon.me". I was going to use .meme but I decided not to just because using .me seemed more professional as a personal portfolio. Adding quite remember how to set all of it up, mainly just the DNS heart everything else I was fine with. But with Jason's help I was able to get it done. It only took a few hours before the website became l live.

{{<image src="/img/Wk6Arti13.PNG" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

It was quite a chill day, and it was also good to spend time with the other members of the studio before our presentation. Listening to Jason talk about his passion for mechanical keyboards and rock-climbing was also entertaining. 

{{<image src="/img/Wk6Arti14.PNG" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

Jason also reminded me that At 2 o'clock I had to go up with him to see Atif so that I could get my summer studio shirt. It was quite a basic set but I really wanted one because I enjoyed this year so much and it would be great to have a physical memento of my time. It sadly UTS logo on it which was pretty cool to me. Will will will

{{<image src="/img/Wk6Arti15.PNG" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

But the best thing about today was not the shirt will or watching Jason play with tiny mechanical keyboard keys. It was Jason introducing me to Kim, so that she could help me with writing a cover letter as well as check my resume for the upcoming job application I had. This was really kind of Jason because I really had no idea how to write a cover letter and to be put in contact with someone who is incredibly proficient at it was extremely helpful.

### Thursday

Today was a really fun day. It was the day of the presentation where we got to showcase all of our hard work and knowledge. It was also a learning experience in and of itself given that we had to explain our projects to people who most likely lacked our technical knowledge. Therefore we had to make sure that our demonstrations were easy to follow and also easy to explain. Unfortunately, we did not have access to external monitors so we had to make do with our small laptops. I chose to record the demo beforehand so that I did not have to worry about any issues with the servers on HackTheBox.

{{<image src="/img/Wk6Arti17.PNG" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

I got some friends to come over to my presentation first to find our bearings. It was difficult the first time but with feedback I was able to easily to adapt and make the presentations easier to understand. I made sure to pay attention to the viewers faces so that I knew if they are able to follow along or are lost on something I said. Furthermore, I tried using as many examples as I could. For example: To explain the difference between a root user and a lower-level user, I would use a metaphor of a parent putting a parental lock on a child's device. I will explain to the viewer that the parent would be the root user in that they had complete control over the system whereas the lower-level user such as www-data would have restricted control much like the child. Most people who came to our presentation were really interested to see just how will easily someone could access a server and obtain root access when outdated servers are used. Overall I am very proud of my groups effort in the presentation. It was also fun to go and look at all the other studios and view their projects. In fact, since I had done the cyber security studio this year, I plan to do the deep learning studio next year since I was very interested in the subject.

{{<image src="/img/Wk6Arti18.PNG" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

 

Other than the demonstration, today was a significant day because it was orientation day or O'day as the kids like to call it. I had clubs I wanted to join and more importantly, I was after the free giveaways. One thing I definitely wanted however, was a cyber security society hoodie. Unfortunately the card reader was not working in the morning nor the afternoon. In the end, most of us just performed a bank transfer and obtained our hoodies. 

{{<image src="/img/Wk6Arti19.PNG" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

The body was really cool so I am very happy with my purchase.  Funnily enough, nearly all the cyber security studio members went down to the cyber security society store and ended up buying out the hoodies. We bought so many, that society had to order more. I did also end up getting a lot of other random merchandise from other benders.

{{<image src="/img/Wk6Arti20.PNG" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

 As for the clubs I had 3 in mind:

- The UTS Oztag club
- The SCUBA club
- Intents (camping)

I ended up joining only 2 of these. I always wanted to play a team sport since high school in which I played football. I loved Oztag but I didn't play completive, only for house sport. I also have some other friends from Uni who joined so it'll be good fun. When I was in the Air Force cadets we had a lot of camps and they were really fun because you could get away from things like school and just chill out with some mates. 

When I signed up for this club, the president was someone I actually knew from work which is pretty cool. They have a meeting in 2 weeks where I get to meet everyone in the club so I'm looking forward to that. Unfortunately, I did not get to join the SCUBA club because in order to join you have to be SCUBA certified. I plan to do this in winter because everyone I know who dives tells me it's a lot cheaper. As soon as I do I'll join the club because they have their own boat and they go for a lot of dives. Overall today was a great experience, especially spending time with not only the members from my summer studio But also getting to see all the fun great projects from the other studio members.

### Friday

I spent a few hours with the OpenAdmin box on HackTheBox. I was able to get shell access however I encountered something I hadn't in a boot2root before. When I first accessed the shell I realised that there was some thing that I was not able to do that I could have done on other boxes. I was restricted to a certain directory. This stopped me in my tracks and forced me to enumerate more than I did for Traverxec. To make matters even worse, after a few attempts to escape my restricted access, the server went down.

{{<image src="/img/Wk6Arti22.PNG" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

It took a lot longer than usual forcing me to stop with my box and focus on my reflection for the day since I had work and I had to complete my daily reflection entry before that.

On a different note, my application for the Junior security analyst role was going well thanks to the help of Larry, Jason, Max, and Kim. Max helped me out first with my resume weeks ago but also sent me resources on writing my first cover letter. Larry helped out by sending me a cover letter he had once used for the same role. It was amazingly useful since I had never written a cover letter before. With Larry's example however, I was able to quickly find my bearings and understand to some degree what I needed to do for mine. I also gave Larry my resume to look at since Max made a point that he was the authority on making awesome resume's.

{{<image src="/img/Wk6Arti23.PNG" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

Jason helped me out first by getting me a t-shirt for O'day but more importantly by putting me in touch with Kim. He also let me know what OpenAdmin was going to be like in advance which prepared at least a little for the Enumeration which I had to undertake today. Kim was definitely a huge help, even though she had commitments of her own such as work, she still took the time to help me out. Although the writing of my first cover letter was largely influenced by her, given the time restraints of the junior security analyst of course. She not only helped me make my resume better:

{{<image src="/img/Wk6Arti24.PNG" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

But she also kindly offered to teach me to properly write my own cover letter. I do plan on applying for more internships such as the ones provided by PWC, Deloitte and also ServiceNow as suggested by Larry. For those, since there is not such a critical time restraint, I can learn how to properly craft a good cover letter. One thing I do want to point out, is that although neither my CV or my Cover letter are perfect, I am satisfied that they are far better than they were when I first compiled them for the role.

### Saturday

Today I split the day into two overall tasks. Working on my reflection for the week which I had not worked on since Wednesday And also working on open admin as much as I could. In terms of the reflection, it took quite a bit of time, but I got basically all of it done. There was a lot of talk about because this week was pretty hectic, not only was there the demonstration on oh day, but also the assignments due and other commitments. I also spent quite a bit of time talking to 1 of my friends who had joined the UTS Oz tag club with me. He plays Oz tag competitively and is pretty good at it so it was really great to have him join with me so he could help me out. I met him in routing and switching essentials at the beginning of the year, we both like Oz tag and we wanted to join the team for a while now. Luckily the Oz tag club allows you to choose who you want to be a team with. WE simply put each of our names on our forms and hopefully we will get to play together when the competition starts On 17 March. 

{{<image src="/img/Wk6Arti25.PNG" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

After I completed the reflection, I moved on to working on open admin. It took a while and a lot of enumeration but eventually I did realize how to tackle the problem that I had. I was able to get access to 1 of the users and I was reassured by other members that I was close to getting the proper user. I cannot publish the artefacts to show it but they will be up when the box has been retired.  I definitely think that Traverxec is easier than open admin, But then again some people found open admin much easier. One thing I will add is due to their similarity, I did not have that much trouble since there were a lot of things I was prepared for by doing Traverxec.

### Sunday

I didn't have much time today, only a few hours in the morning before I had to go to work. In that little time I did some more enumeration on open admin and I feel as if I know what to do to complete it before this Tuesday. I also started working on my final post reflection, every time I do it however I feel sad because I know that this studio will end and most of us will leave. There is some solace in that when I go to B-sides I will be staying with a lot of the members from the studio. 

### Conclusion

Definitely a hectic week to be sure. Many fun times, a lot of brain numbing enumeration. Not to mention the sneakiest root I have ever come across with the Traverxec box. A lot of work is due by the 3rd, but I have confidence that I will be able to get it done in time. One of the things I am definitely going to say, is that out of all my time at this university, this studio will be definitely one that I never forget. I came to this studio as a kid with barely any real knowledge of packing, and even less experience. Despite this, I was thrown in the deep end, pushed to my limits, met some amazing people, and came out significantly better. I now have my own portfolio website, I have a strong resume and cover letter, and most importantly of all, I have real practical experience with Web-pentesting will.
