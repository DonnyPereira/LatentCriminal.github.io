# 41152 Summer Studio 2020

# Introduction

---
["/img/hello.jpg"]

I can only describe my time in this Studio as one-of-a-kind. I can say without fear of conviction that I came into the studio with very little or rather no knowledge of the subject material. I did however have a few goals at the beginning of the studio:

– Gain practical knowledge and experience with penetration testing.

– Complete a project based on penetration testing that I could put on a portfolio.

– Learn about the practice of cyber security in general.

I can say that I have achieved all of these goals and much more. Every deliverable we've had for this subject was heavily practical which I really enjoyed because I learn better through labs rather than lectures. Not only did I complete a single project based on penetration testing, but I completed multiple boot2roots and capture the flag (CTF) challenges. 

Boot2roots are challenges where an attacker is given little to no information on a target system ( usually a Web server in our case, aka a "box" ) and the goal is to achieve root access. Root access is just a term for highest administrative access. Therefore, I gained practical knowledge with penetration testing over a range of boxes, all of which I can place on my Portfolio.

To make things even better, in our first week we created the static website you are reading this post on. So not only do I have projects to put on a portfolio, I also now have a portfolio itself. Furthermore, due to the intense practical focus of the subject, I have gained a lot of experience and confidence in the field of cyber security. 

The remainder of this post is to demonstrate my final reflection and evidence of myself meeting the 5 subject learning outcomes (SLO's) presented within the subject outline of the studio. Before I move on, I would like to express my extreme gratitude to the tutors; Max, Larry, and Jason for their guidance and support. Because of them, I was able to take my first steps into the information security industry, and greatly develop myself. I also want to take this time to thank the other members of the studio for their help and for making the studio the great experience that it was. I am truly sad, that my time with them is over. 

# Final Reflection

---

## SLO 1 - Engage with stakeholders to identify a problem

Each week of the studio offered a different problem for which the students had to develop solutions for. After each week, the students would attain knowledge that would help them tackle the next problem offered by the studio.

### Week 2

Since I missed the orientation for the first week. This is the week we officially dived into the core information security material, our first steps into developing an offensive mindset. We were greeted 2 speakers, one of which - Robert Mitchell helped us understand the overall nature of cyber security. Robert Mitchell was a very interesting man, currently working at Gitlab, he had had a long career in cyber security. 


Robert's talk was so beneficial as it not only went through the current nature of cyber security but built on it by going through its history, its relation to social culture, and its overall impact on the world past, present and future. He explained how hacking was, in essence, finding vulnerabilities in current systems and also the consequence of human error. Furthermore, the presentation also went through the consequences of failing to recognizing the risk of a cyber attack.

### Week 3

Every group had to find a unique web-application attack and record it. After researching, delivering with my group, and listening to the other presentations, I was able to piece together more of the problem statement for this week. 

An example of this would be the attack that my group presented - an SQL injection. An SQL injection is simply the inputting of malicious SQL code into a prompt that utilises SQL and thus giving an attacker unauthorized access to private information. Lack of knowledge would come into this and that a lot of sites that were vulnerable to this type of attack not quarantining their input and thus would not be able to defend against such an attack. 

{{<image src="/img/Wk7Arti1.PNG" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

The interesting thing about these presentations, was the engagement with the tutors. The attacks that we were talking about were fairly complicated to the average person and thus so we were able to identify a secondary problem within information security. That being, the increased necessity to be able to quickly articulate to stakeholders that are not knowledgeable in the InfoSec field, critical information related to cyber security.

In addition, I also had the pleasure to meet with external stakeholders as I registered for a seminar held by the SecTalks group. The topic of the discussion was digital forensics deliver by Phil Moore who had recently worked for the police force. Here I gained more knowledge about problems in the information security industry that were not strictly related to penetration testing. 

### Weeks 4, 5 and 6

I have grouped these weeks together, as it is in these weeks that we completed different boot to roots each with their own problems. After each box completed, we were alerted to different problems with common applications. Some boxes utilised out of date plug-ins, others would not properly secure their file system, et cetera. By penetrating into these different systems, documenting the process, and outlining any mitigation strategies, I was able to abstractly identify common problems with different systems.

{{<image src="/img/Wk7Arti2.PNG" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

By the end of the studio and after identifying each micro-problem, I was able to piece together the overall problem. My final problem statement that I was able to weave together over the weeks in this studio is as such:

human error, lack of information security knowledge, utilisation of outdated systems, and poor communication skills with InfoSec professionals can negatively impact stakeholders, financially, legally and reputationally.

## SLO 2 – Apply design and systems thinking to respond to a defined or newly Identified problem

{{<image src="/img/Wk5Arti0.PNG" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

### Week 2

Above is the web application penetration testing methodology presented by the tutors. It is basically an abstracted workflow for penetration testing. It facilitated not only the process of testing the system but also making sure to properly document any necessary information. We are made to understand that each step relied on the step before it and that the reporting was critical as this is what companies and individuals would use to protect their systems. 

### Week 4

Until week 4 I'd never really utilised the web pen-testing methodology that was introduced in week 2. although I did attempt and finish the basic pen-testing 1 box in week 3, I will admit that I did it without following a proper structure and relying more on tools. However in week 4 I decided to properly implement the design and system thinking methodology to tackle the challenges of my first intermediate box – Mr robot on TryHackMe. This also helped me see how the problem statement that I had developed up until now was practically involved as I would document my methods and the mitigation strategies for the system.

{{<image src="/img/Wk7Arti4.PNG" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

### Week 5 and 6

In these weeks I heavily relied on the web pen-testing methodology as it streamlined my process of getting into the system. The boxes in these weeks were a lot harder than that of week 4 and by following such a methodology I was able to become more productive whilst at the same time truly understanding the financial, legal, and reputational consequences of insecure systems. 

The use of the web pen testing methodology was also backed up by 2 members of the Deloitte cyber security team that gave a talk on Thursday. They too stressed the vital importance of logging every tool, detail, and action. This is because in the real world, the consequences for not properly logging import information is not a bad grade. But rather being fired or even worse having customers taken advantage of by malicious attackers due to insecure systems via incomplete documentation. Another important fact about the importance of such processes and documentation, is responsibility. Penetration testers are responsible for their actions and without proper ethical methodology, they confine themselves being prosecuted.

The biggest problem I faced when trying to implement this methodology was inability to maintain it towards the end. Sometimes when completing a box like the open admin box in week 6, I would use the methodology until I reached a user. Then I would continue with testing the box and forget that I also had to complete the writup therefore costing me time later on.

## SLO 3 – Apply technical skills to develop, model, and/or evaluate designs

### Week 1

- The first week was not so much about cyber-security, rather it acted as a primer for the weeks to come. Right from the beginning the students were thrown into the deep end with nothing but a metaphorical depth gauge and compass. The compass being our Tutors who told us what the aim was - to create a functional public webpage and to be able to update it. Our depth gauge was the wiki they posted on Microsoft teams to give us a rough bearing.

{{<image src="/img/Wk7Arti6.PNG" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

- This task hit the SLO directly, it was a challenge that was out of our comfort zone. Most of use had used html and Css to make webpages but knew nothing about using static site generators, DNS settings or git. Through self-propelled learning, we learnt and applied the technical skills to first find a design we liked and then to actually go about building the site.
- Technical skills involved:
    1. Learn and use Hugo to produce functional markdown-based pages.
    2. Learn git or utilise PowerShell to clone Github repositories into home folders and then update the site.
    3. Browse and model designs fit for a professional Web-based portfolio.
    4. Apply technical networking knowledge to set up domain names and DNS setting for Netlify to update the static site based on changes to Github.
- More information can be found in the "Reflection" post on this site.

### Week 2

- The theme this week was web application penetration testing. In terms of application of technical skills, I applied such skills by attempting and completing a number of Linux Capture the flags (CTFs). These CTFs were the Bandit challenges on [OvertheWire.com](http://overthewire.com). The aim was to use this resource to better understand the Linux system so that I could tackle the problems in the later weeks when Kali linux would be utilised.
- I also dual booted my pc with CentOS as I was studying the Linux+ exam which is based on the CentOS system. The only problem I faced was that I could not get the wi-fi to work with CentOS when I was at University.
- Flags Captured and write-ups on Bandit:

{{<image src="/img/Wk7Arti7.PNG" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

### Week 3

By week 3 I had improved my technical skills and I was doing many practical labs and CTF's. The deliverable was a practical task too. We had to demonstrate an SQL injection in whilst also explaining mitigation strategies. A few more of the practical tasks I undertook requiring application of technical skills.

- OWASP Juice shop instance
    1. SQL challenge
    2. Cross-site scripting (XSS)
    3. Steganography
- Overthewire
    1. Bandit
    2. Natas
- Hacksplaining
    1. SQL injection
    2. Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Portswigger
    1.  SQL
- Pentester labs
    1. Unix labs
    2. Beginner labs

### Week 4

This is where I had to utilise all the technical skills I had learnt up until this week. The deliverable for this week was our first boot2root, I choose the Mr Robot box as I wanted to challenge myself. Since this was an intermediate box I had to utilise both the pen-tester methodology as well as a number of tools and methods. The full write up can be found on the "Week 4 Robot Box WriteUp".

- Had to check robots.txt for hidden files
- Had to recognize necessity of wpscan and use it to gain access into the server.
- Used a malicious plugin to force access to a reverse shell.
- took advantage of Nmap sudo privileges and gain root status

### Week 5 and 6

Just like the Mr Robot box there were a number of practical and technical challenges associated with the Traverxec and OpenAdmin Boxes. However Due to the rules of HacktheBox, I cannot show them on this post. After the boxes are retired, they will be posted on my site.

## SLO 4 – Demonstrate effective collaboration and communication skills

Collaboration and communication were demonstrated thoroughly in this studio. This was not just limited to the tutors of course. The group assignments required the students to form groups and communicate so to ensure a good presentation, et cetera.

### Week 2 and 3

- Communication was primary in the form of group discussion. In these 2 weeks, I was in two different groups, each time, myself and the members would collaborate often. We had to first delegate roles and define responsibilities before each member could proceed. Constant communication before we presented was also necessary to ensure that all members were ready for the day.

{{<image src="/img/Wk7Arti8.PNG" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

- Communication was also showcased after each deliverable submission and group oral presentation. The tutors would inform my group on aspects on my presentation that were done well but also on aspects that needed improvement thus always facilitating room for improvement.

### Week 4

- I had the opportunity this week to communicate with outside stakeholders as I attended a talk hosted by Sectalks at PWC. I was able to communicate with other members who were proficient in the InfoSec industry as well as learn about an aspect of hacking not covered explicitly in the studio - Digital forensics.

### Week 5 and 6

- As the studio was coming to an end, all the members of the group had become comfortable with talking to one another. Furthermore during week 6 we had to present to external members who attended O'day.
- It was a great experience since the members had to be able to demonstrate Information security concepts to non-security minded individuals. This involved proper understanding of the concepts that were being explained so that the presentation could be articulated succinctly and appropriately.

{{<image src="/img/Wk7Arti9.PNG" alt="Hello Friend" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

- There was also a "Ninja night" hosted by Sectalks where more members of the summer studio showed up. The challenge was a Team-based CTF where our team had to communicate with each other to get the flag.
- On the night, the other team that one showcased their method to the whole audience. Because of the communication from this team I was able to learn how to tackle similar CTF's in the future.

## SLO 5 – Conduct critical self, peer, and group review and performance evaluation

### Self

Over the course of the studio, I have changed dramatically, I would actually regard this subject as the best I have ever had. I have learnt the importance of humility and the importance of accepting my flaws as the most crucial step to changing. Every challenge made me realise the gaps in my knowledge and also helped me identify areas of improvement. Due to the stand-up meeting and mandatory reflection posts, I had to talk about my shortcomings, a few of which are here below:

- Time-management
- Procrastination
- Scheduling problems

More importantly, to measure performance we had to implement plans to overcome such barriers. In fact, struggling and overcoming barriers was a recurring theme each week. Every week involved harder challenges than the week before it, and each time we felt as if the task was beyond our competence, in many cases it was. But that's what we needed to get used to, even when the challenge looked impossible, the tutors would push us to try harder and never give in, except to convictions of good sense. The only way to increase our competence was to challenge it. I came to this studio with:

- poor time management.
- little confidence and practical experience of penetration testing.
- barely any knowledge of the Information Security pathways available to me.

I am leaving with:

- Improved time management and stricter control over procrastination.
- A burning desire to root as many boxes as I can get my hands on.
- A reservation for Bsides Canberra, and I plan to attend as many conferences as possible
- Knowledge of the companies in the Information security industry as well as certifications I wish to undertake for greater knowledge.
- A web portfolio.
- A better resume and amazing cover letter.

### Peer and Group

There was only a small amount of group work at the beginning of the studio and towards the end so I'll comment on that first. As a group for my first 2 presentations, I feel as though all members put in an amazing effort both into planning and execution of deliverables. All members were professional, took note of any feed-back given to them and improved because of it. Furthermore, all members of this studio were amazing to work with. We all struggled together, learned together and laughed together, and I can say with certainty that we have all gained immeasurable experience  because of this course. 

In terms of Peers, there is more to say, there were barriers, not all of us had the best English vocabulary, some of us were not as skilled with certain boxes, and so on. One of these barriers showcased itself in the last week when the presentations were due. Phillip and myself had completed the Traverxec box but Matthew had not. Nevertheless we helped out out peer by giving subtle hints but making sure not to give direct answers. This way we could still help our peer without robbing of the opportunity to learn.

I can say with confidence after speaking with my peers over this course that, we all had goals in the beginning, and we have surpassed them by the end. Everyone also had to take part in weekly sprints and reflections thus allowing each and every member, myself included, to access our progress. The goal was to always utilise the sprint stand-up meetings to identify positive and negative aspects of the previous week whilst also defining methods to overcome said negative aspects. The reflection then supported this by acting as a secondary performance evaluation by assessing how effective the methods we put in place were.

# Conclusion

---

My goals before the studio

– Gain practical knowledge and experience with penetration testing.

– Complete a project based on penetration testing that I could put on a portfolio.

– Learn about the practice of cyber security in general.

What I have attained:

Significantly gained practical knowledge in web pen-testing and many other capture the flag wargames.

I now have an amazing web portfolio that I can manage myself, and an amazing cover letter

Knowledge of the companies in the Information security industry as well as certifications I wish to undertake for greater knowledge.

Knowledge of the pathways I need to undertake to advance myself in the InfoSec industry

In conclusion, this subject is the best subject I have had so far and I hope it runs again next semester. The subject content was amazing and skillfully delivered, I have far more than I could conceive at the beginning. The tutors were absolutely phenomenal and I am going to truly miss them. Not only did they teach me about cybersecurity, they taught me how to write a better resume, to be more confident and to never give up. My goal is to spend this year educating myself as much as I can so that I could possibly be a tutor for this next semester if possible. I also plan to be an executive of the cyber security society as I am genuinely in love with the subject. Most of all I will never forget my peers. I am going to Bsides in May which is a huge cybersecurity event and I will see some of them there which is good. But I am truly sad that we will part ways. Without them, this studio would not have been what is was.
